Inventory App

---

In leu of a scenario from SNHU I was tasked with building an application to track items within a warehouse.  The application includes the following features: 
*A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords.
*A screen for logging into the app.
*A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory.
*A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory.
*A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory.
*A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero).

The screen and features needed for the user experience are the log-in screen, the inventory screen, adding/editing/deleting icons, sms notifications, and log out button. These are all very simple things for a user to do. My design I think where successful as I used simple icons for the user to understand.

The coding of the app was built over time from projects one and two three adds a completed application. I used many techniques and strategies resourced from https://developer.android.com/reference. I think these strategies can be applied to any coding class or project going forward.
I tested the code as I went, even though I had a few bugs to debug at the end I was able to get a pretty good working application.
I think over the development process I was able to take a very “basic” idea and make a simple app. I had quite a few challenges during this process but with research and tutoring help I was able to debug issues. 
I think the once component that demonstrates my knowledge, skills and experience is the layout of the code, and the design of the finale application.
